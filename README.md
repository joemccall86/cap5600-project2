# Project 2 (Working Title)

## Overview

The distribution of scarce resources is a common problem. Specifically, test kits for the recent COVID-19 pandemic are in very short supply. It is still crucial to understand how many people are infected at which hospitals. This project abstracts the problem as a classical [multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) AI problem. The goal is to determine if an intelligent agent (utilizing an epsilon-greedy algorithm) can outperform a naive approach when distributing test kits to hospitals as infections grow.

## Requirements

This project is built with Python 3.8
